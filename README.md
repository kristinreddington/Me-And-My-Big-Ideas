Reflection


I wanted to build an application that allowed me to track all my ideas. I have a hand-written journal, but needed a way to store my thoughts digitally, where adding images and editing existing ideas were seamless.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Paperclip, axios, as well as Ruby, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on implementing Redux to track state within a store so I can scale accordingly.
